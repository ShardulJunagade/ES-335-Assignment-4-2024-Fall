# Model Performance Comparison

The table below compares the performance metrics of different models based on training and testing.

| Model           | Training Time | Training Loss | Training Accuracy | Testing Accuracy | Number of Parameters |
|------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Model 1         |               |               |                   |                   |                       |
| Model 2         |               |               |                   |                   |                       |
| Model 3         |               |               |                   |                   |                       |
| Model 4         |               |               |                   |                   |                       |
| Model 5         |               |               |                   |                   |                       |
